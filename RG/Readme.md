Creating a Terraform module for creating a Resource Group in Azure with tagging involves several steps. Below is a basic example of how you can structure this module. I'll assume you're familiar with the basic Terraform syntax and concepts.

First, you'll need to create a directory structure for your module. Typically, this might look something like this:

```hcl
RG/
└── resource_group/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    └── outputs.tf

```

In the main.tf file, you define the actual resource creation logic. Here's an example main.tf that defines a resource group with tags:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  # Define your provider configuration here
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "this" {
  name     = var.name
  location = var.location
  tags     = var.tags
}
```

In the variables.tf file, you define variables that your module will accept:

```hcl
variable "name" {
  description = "The name of the resource group"
  type        = string
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The location of the resource group"
  type        = string
}

variable "tags" {
  description = "A map of tags to add to the resource group"
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {}
}
```
In the outputs.tf file, you define outputs that your module will return:

```hcl
output "resource_group_id" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.this.id
  description = "The ID of the resource group"
}

output "resource_group_location" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.this.location
  description = "The location of the resource group"
}

output "resource_group_name" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.this.name
  description = "The name of the resource group"
}
```

After defining your module, you can use it in your Terraform configurations like this:

```hcl
module "resource_group" {
  source   = "./RG/resource_group"
  name     = "my-resource-group"
  location = "Southeast Asia"
  tags     = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Project     = "Project Name"
  }
}
```

Don't forget to initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:
```hcl
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This code defines a module that creates an Azure resource group with the specified name, location, and tags. You can customize the module by modifying the variables and resources as needed for your specific use case.
